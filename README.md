## Slender: Insanity source code
This repository contains the source code for my Unity game "Slender: Insanity".

It does not contain the Unity project nor the textures, models, maps, sounds or any other asset. This means that the code itself is not very useful on its own and it's not enough to fork the project, but I'm releasing it here anyways in case someone is curious about the source.

The source found here reflects the game versions from 2.0 onward. Past versions such as 1.5 or the earliest 0.2 are not included here. Version 2.0 is currently being worked on, with plans to be released sometime between December 2025 and early 2026.
